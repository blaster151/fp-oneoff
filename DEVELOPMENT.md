# Development Chronicle

This document serves as an ongoing chronicle of development insights, decisions, and thoughts that may not be directly reflected in the codebase.

## Project Setup (Initial)

### 2024-12-19 - Project Initialization

**Setup Decisions:**
- Chose TypeScript with strict mode for type safety
- ES2020 target for modern JavaScript features
- CommonJS modules for Node.js compatibility
- Source maps enabled for better debugging experience
- Nodemon for hot reloading during development

**Architecture Choices:**
- Simple `src/` structure for source files
- `dist/` for compiled output
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts
- README with clear setup instructions

**Development Workflow:**
- `npm run dev` for development with hot reloading
- `npm run build` for production compilation
- `npm start` to run compiled code
- Git integration with GitHub for version control

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add ESLint for code quality
- [ ] Add Prettier for code formatting
- [ ] Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider adding Express.js for web server capabilities
- [ ] Database integration if needed

### Technical Decisions to Revisit
- Module system choice (CommonJS vs ESM)
- Build tool considerations (tsc vs esbuild/vite)
- Testing strategy
- Deployment approach

## Insights & Learnings

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode provides excellent type safety but requires careful attention to types
- Source maps are invaluable for debugging compiled code
- Declaration files help with IDE support and documentation

### Development Experience
- Hot reloading with nodemon significantly improves development speed
- Clear separation between source and build directories keeps things organized
- Comprehensive documentation helps with onboarding and maintenance

## Notes & Ideas

*This section is for capturing random thoughts, ideas, and insights that come up during development.*

### Code Organization
- Consider organizing by feature rather than type as project grows
- Think about dependency injection patterns for better testability
- Plan for configuration management early

### Performance Considerations
- TypeScript compilation can be slow for large projects
- Consider incremental builds for development
- Think about bundle size optimization if building for web

*This document will be updated as the project evolves and new insights emerge.*
