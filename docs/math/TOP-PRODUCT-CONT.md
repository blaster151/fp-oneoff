**Statement (LaTeX).**
The product topology is initial with respect to projections; hence $\pi_1, \pi_2$ are continuous, and
$$
f : Z\to X\times Y \text{ is continuous} \iff \pi_1\circ f \text{ and } \pi_2\circ f \text{ are continuous}.
$$

**Construction.**
Product topology $\tau_{X \times Y}$ is generated by basic rectangles $U \times V$ where $U \in \tau_X$ and $V \in \tau_Y$. Opens are arbitrary unions of basic rectangles.

**Universal Property.**
For any topological space $(Z, \tau_Z)$ and continuous maps $f_1: Z \to X$, $f_2: Z \to Y$, there exists a unique continuous map $\langle f_1, f_2 \rangle: Z \to X \times Y$ such that $\pi_1 \circ \langle f_1, f_2 \rangle = f_1$ and $\pi_2 \circ \langle f_1, f_2 \rangle = f_2$.

**Implications (TypeScript).**
- `productTopology(TX, TY)` constructs product topology
- `pr1`, `pr2` projection functions
- `verifyProductUniversalProperty` tests universal property
- Continuity tests via `isContinuous`

**Implementation Details.**
- Basic rectangles: `rectangle(Aset, Bset, U, V)` creates $U \times V$
- Union generation: All unions of basic rectangles via powerset
- Encoding: Bitstring representation for efficient membership testing

**Test Hook.**
`src/types/__tests__/topology-product.test.ts` - product topology properties

**Witness Laws.**
- Projections continuous: $\pi_1, \pi_2$ are continuous maps
- Universal property: Factorization through product
- Boolean operations continuous: $\land : 2 \times 2 \to 2$ is continuous

**Future Unlocks.**
- Infinite products via Tychonoff theorem (requires choice)
- Exponential objects in topological categories
- Cartesian closed structure for nice topological spaces
- Applications to locale theory and pointless topology
