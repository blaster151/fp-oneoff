# Implementation Scope and Limitations (collection)

## [SCOPE-FINITE-SET]
id: SCOPE-FINITE-SET
tags: [scope, finite, limitations]
source: knowledge:"Current implementation boundaries"
---
**Current Scope**  
Implementation restricted to finite Set and tiny toy categories. No large/enriched ends yet.

**Implications (TS)**  
- `SetObj<A>` with finite carriers only
- `SmallCategory` with enumerable objects/morphisms
- `MiniFinSet` with 499 precomputed morphisms maximum

**Limitations**  
- No infinite sets or large categories
- No enriched category theory beyond Set
- Exponential complexity limits practical size

**Future unlocks**  
- Lazy evaluation for larger finite categories
- Enriched ends beyond Set (Top, Ab, etc.)
- Large category abstractions with streaming

## [LIMITATION-END-MACHINERY]
id: LIMITATION-END-MACHINERY
tags: [ends, transporter, discrete]
source: knowledge:"Current end computation limitations"
---
**Current Status**  
End transporter uses existing machinery—correct for discrete B and typical Set-valued cases, but not stress-tested on complex categories.

**Tested Cases**  
- Discrete categories (only identity morphisms)
- Simple Set-valued functors
- Small finite categories (< 500 morphisms)

**Untested/Unknown**  
- Non-discrete categories with complex morphism structure
- Large categories with thousands of objects
- Enriched functors beyond Set

**Implications (TS)**  
- `RightKan_Set` works for tested cases
- Dinaturality constraints verified for simple cases
- May need refinement for complex categories

**Future unlocks**  
- Stress testing on larger categories
- Alternative end computation algorithms
- Enriched end machinery

## [COMPLEXITY-EXPONENTIAL]
id: COMPLEXITY-EXPONENTIAL
tags: [complexity, performance, exponential]
source: knowledge:"Exponential growth in finite set constructions"
---
**Mathematical Reality**  
Complexity grows exponentially: |T^G(A)| = ∏_b |G b|^{|G b|^|A|} creates very large sets quickly.

**Example Growth**  
- A = {0,1}, G(b1) = {0,1}, G(b2) = {x,y,z}
- Result: |T^G(A)| = 2^4 × 3^9 = 314,928 elements
- Adding one element to A: exponential explosion

**Current Status**  
- Exploratory code, not production-optimized
- Suitable for mathematical verification and small examples
- Performance bottlenecks with larger finite sets

**Implications (TS)**  
- `CodensitySet` creates large intermediate structures
- Memory usage grows exponentially
- Computation time increases dramatically with size

**Future unlocks**  
- Lazy evaluation and streaming
- Symbolic computation without enumeration
- Performance optimization via CPS transformation
- Memoization and caching strategies

## [STATUS-EXPLORATORY]

- Small-scale categorical experiments
- Research and education
- Proof-of-concept implementations

**Not Appropriate For**  
- Production systems with large data

## [DISCRETE-CATEGORY-FOCUS]
id: DISCRETE-CATEGORY-FOCUS
tags: [discrete, categories, tested]
source: knowledge:"Primary testing domain"

**Primary Testing Domain**  
Most verification done on discrete categories where non-identity morphisms are minimal or absent.

**Why Discrete Categories**  
- Simpler dinaturality constraints
- End computation reduces to products
- Easier mathematical verification
- Clear cardinality formulas

**Implications**  
- Robust for discrete case
- Less tested for complex morphism structures
- May need adaptation for richer categories
- Good foundation for extension

**Future unlocks**  
- Testing on non-discrete categories
- Complex morphism structure handling
- Enriched category extensions
- General categorical machinery

Despite limitations, the mathematical foundation is solid and correctly implements the theory.

**Verified Properties**  
- Codensity T^G = Ran_G G construction
- Product formula for discrete categories
- Unit and multiplication laws
- Continuation semantics

**Theoretical Soundness**  
- Based on established category theory
- Correct implementation of end formulas
